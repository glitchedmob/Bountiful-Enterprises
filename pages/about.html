					<p>“I really appreciate the willingness to work with James and myself when we were at your shop. You have a great thing going there. Tommy and your other staff took pride in their work and working with us. It’s not often that I have the opportunity to enjoy a day at the fab shop. I really appreciate the respect and willingness to work with the inspector that you all showed. The homemade lunch was great too. Your shop has a pride of craftsmanship that I don’t see much anymore. I think that is cool. I look forward to working with your organization again.”</p>

					<p>“I recently had the opportunity to work with a steel manufacturer by the name of Bountiful out of Humansville, MO. I am very impressed with their accuracy and quality of their workmanship as well as their willingness to work with us in every aspect. O’Reilly’s Corp, is a 38,000 sq ft 3 story building and we only had to move 2 clips and drill 1 hole. Josh Ashman has been more then helpful; in fact has gone out of his way to help. My Thanks goes to Josh and the team at Bountiful for a job well done. I highly recommend using Bountiful. If their work is as good on every job as it is on this one, I think we would be money ahead.”</p>
